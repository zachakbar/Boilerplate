# Boilerplate

A responsive boilerplate to start basic web pages/sites with.

Your choice of compiling, set up for CodeKit or Gulp.

required packages for gulp:
* [gulp](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp) 
* [gulp-sass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sass) 
* [gulp-compass](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-compass) 
* [gulp-watch](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-watch) 
* [gulp-concat](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-concat) 
* [gulp-minify](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-minify) 
* [gulp-sourcemaps](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-sourcemaps) 
* [gulp-util](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-util) 

I have the <code>node_modules</code> folder sitting in my root Sites directory. No need to upload for each project, IMO.
