A responsive boilerplate to start basic web pages/sites with.

make sure you have installed both [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [gulp.js](https://gulpjs.com/).

_NO MORE GEMS!! Also, we are no longer using Compass so be aware when using compass mixins, you WILL get a compiler error._

```html
cd PROJECT/FOLDER/PATH/
```

```html
git clone https://github.com/zachakbar/boilerplate-core.git PROJECT_NAME
```
3. change folder to the one just created
```html
cd PROJECT_NAME
```
4. install the node modules using the package.json
```html
npm install
```
5. start gulp and begin making magic
```

```

_**tip:** make sure to exclude the **node_modules** and **.sass-cache** folder from uploading. you can also remove the **styles.html** and **README.md** if you so choose._
